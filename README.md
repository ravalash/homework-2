# Features
Nav bar is dyanmic, shifting content to right at large view points, left at medium view points, and collapsing at small viewpoints. Nav bar is also sticky and does not move. Columns on profile page collapse below large viewpoints for easier viewing. Content is justified left at large view points and centered at lower view poiints.

# Code Example
    <header class="sticky-top">
        <!--Container is used to allow link elements justified to end  -->
        <div class="container" style="background-color: slategray;">
            <!-- expand above small break point. left padding removed for content alignment -->
            <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-dark pl-0  h-100">
                <!-- left margin expanded to align content -->
                <a class=" navbar-brand ml-5  " href="#" style="background-color:darkgrey">Adam
                    Parsons</a>
                <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarNav"
                    aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
                    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
